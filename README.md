# re_and_pandas_fun

This is a simple python program that analyzes [linkedin data engineer job postings](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/linkedin-data-engineer-job-postings)

Findings in this little project:

1. The average number of required years of experience for all linkedin data engineer job postings from the dataset above (I used regular expressions and pandas for this)
2. The distribution of remote, hybrid, and onsite jobs (I used pandas for this)
